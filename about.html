            <h2>Frontend Developer!</h2>
            <p>Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Arnav Raj, a passionate and ambitious individual currently pursuing my B. Tech degree at IIIT Bhagalpur and simultaneously completing a BSc in CSDA from IIT Patna in hybrid mode. I take pride in achieving success in JEE mains without taking any drop year, demonstrating my dedication and commitment.

                Beyond academics, I am a seasoned Senior guitarist with a 4-year degree in guitar courses, showcasing my love for music and commitment to honing my skills. My journey also includes a keen interest in programming, where I am currently focusing on mastering Python, C, C++, HTML, and CSS.
                
                My coding journey has led me to explore various projects, particularly in front-end development. I've successfully contributed to building my school's website and have completed projects such as JARVIS, Floppy Bird, and a Health Management System using Python. Additionally, my proficiency in web development is highlighted by projects like a dummy of Amazon's front page.
                
                I am passionate about creating engaging and user-friendly web interfaces, and I'm eager to leverage my skills in a dynamic work environment. Let's connect and explore opportunities where I can contribute my technical expertise and creativity! ðŸš€ #CodingEnthusiast #FrontEndDeveloper #TechInnovator</p>
